# Angular 100 Pre-Work Training Materials - Instructions

## Project Overview
Self-paced training materials for software developers learning Angular. Target audience includes developers with varying web platform experience—some from React, others primarily backend developers. Materials designed for 1-2 day completion for experienced developers.

## Project Purpose
Help developers build foundational knowledge before starting Angular training. Covers development environment setup and web platform fundamentals that Angular builds upon.

## Key Conventions

### File Naming
- **Always use snake-case** for folders and files: `the-development-environment/`, `our-editor.md`
- NOT camelCase, kebab-case, or PascalCase

### Content Structure
Each topic file follows this pattern:
1. **Key Points** - Bulleted list of essential concepts
2. **Why This Matters** - Paragraph explaining relevance to Angular development
3. **Further Reading** - Links to official documentation (NOT labeled "Official Documentation")

### Tone and Style
- Conservative on details - overview depth, not exhaustive
- Concise over verbose
- Practical focus - "what you need for Angular development"
- Acknowledge company tool restrictions exist (user will edit later)
- Use phrases like "Take the full [topic] training for deeper knowledge" when appropriate

```

**Note:** All training content now lives in the Astro site. The site is the single source of truth for all documentation.

## Astro Starlight Site

### Site Structure
The training materials are published as an Astro Starlight documentation site located in `site/` directory.

**Key Locations:**
- Content files: `site/src/content/docs/guide/`
- Configuration: `site/astro.config.mjs`
- Landing page: `site/src/content/docs/index.mdx`

**Running the site:**
```bash
cd site
npm run dev      # Development server (http://localhost:4321)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

### Starlight Frontmatter Requirements
Every content file in the site **must** have frontmatter with `title` and `description`:

```markdown
---
title: Our Editor
description: Configure Visual Studio Code for Angular development with essential extensions and settings
---

Content starts here (no H1 header - Starlight generates it from title)
```

**Important:**
- Do NOT include `# Title` header after frontmatter - Starlight generates it
- Descriptions should be concise (80-160 characters)
- All other markdown (H2, H3, lists, code blocks, etc.) works normally

### Sidebar Configuration
Sidebar navigation is defined in `site/astro.config.mjs` under `starlight.sidebar`:

```javascript
sidebar: [
  {
    label: 'Getting Started',
    items: [
      { label: 'Overview', slug: 'guide' },
      { label: 'Keyboard Shortcuts Cheat Sheet', slug: 'guide/keyboard-shortcuts-cheat-sheet' },
    ],
  },
  {
    label: 'The Development Environment',
    items: [
      { label: 'Our Editor', slug: 'guide/the-development-environment/our-editor' },
      // ... more items
    ],
  },
]
```

**Conventions:**
- Group related topics under labeled sections
- Use descriptive labels (can differ from file names)
- Slugs map to file paths without `.md` extension
- Order matches pedagogical progression

### Internal Links
Use Starlight's absolute path format for links between pages:

```markdown
[Our Editor](/guide/the-development-environment/our-editor/)
```

**NOT relative links:**
```markdown
[Our Editor](../the-development-environment/our-editor.md)  ❌
```

### Content Organization
All training content files live in `site/src/content/docs/guide/`:
- `guide/index.md` - Overview and table of contents
- `guide/keyboard-shortcuts-cheat-sheet.md` - Quick reference
- `guide/the-development-environment/` - 4 topic files
- `guide/the-web-platform/` - 8 topic files

**When updating content:** Edit files directly in `site/src/content/docs/guide/` - there is no separate source.

### Starlight Features in Use
- **Splash template**: Used on home page (`index.mdx`) for hero/card grid layout
- **Card/CardGrid components**: For visual organization on landing page
- **Built-in search**: Automatically indexes all content
- **Dark mode**: Automatic theme switcher
- **Mobile responsive**: Sidebar collapses on mobile
- **Syntax highlighting**: Code blocks automatically highlighted

## Completed Work Status

### ✅ Fully Complete
1. **Astro Starlight documentation site** - All 12 topic files with proper frontmatter, organized sidebar, professional landing page
2. **Guide overview** (guide/index.md) - Table of contents with enhanced introductions and organized sections
3. **video-guides.md** - Complete recording guides for all 12 topics (~2.75-3.25 hours total)
4. **Keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet** - Comprehensive quick reference integrated into the site

### Video Guide Structure
Each video guide includes:
- Target duration (10-22 minutes per topic)
- Sectioned timeline with specific minute allocations
- Concrete demonstrations with code/command examples
- Talking points for each section
- Pre-recording checklist (where applicable)

## Content Guidelines

### Development Environment Topics
- VS Code: Focus on workspaces, settings, extensions, .vscode folder
- Shell: Basic navigation, PATH, environment variables, command chaining
- Git: Basic workflow (clone, add, commit, push), .gitignore, conflict basics
- Node/npm: Why Node for tooling, package.json structure, npm scripts, semantic versioning

### Web Platform Topics
- WWW: HTTP request/response, status codes, REST APIs, JSON
- HTML: Document structure, semantic elements, attributes
- CSS: Selectors, box model, Flexbox/Grid, Tailwind vs Angular Material comparison
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML foundation, WCAG basics, screen readers, testing tools
- JavaScript: Modern syntax (ES6+), Promises/async-await, array methods, Fetch API/CORS
- DevTools: Console, Elements, Network, debugging, device emulation
- DOM: Manipulation, event handling, SPA concept, data-DOM synchronization challenge
- TypeScript: Type annotations, interfaces, classes, compiler basics, Angular context

## Important Decisions Made

1. **Naming Convention**: Switched from camelCase to snake-case for all files/folders
2. **Link Labels**: Use "Further Reading" not "Official Documentation"
3. **Section Introductions**: Each major section in Before-You-Start.md has introductory paragraph
4. **Angular Context**: Each topic explains "Why This Matters" specifically for Angular development
5. **Tooling Decisions**: Acknowledge Angular Material vs Tailwind without prescribing choice
6. **Depth**: Conservative approach - overview sufficient for class work, point to deeper training
7. **TypeScript**: Use `type` over `interface` in examples to help Java/.NET developers approach with fresh eyes (acknowledge both exist)
8. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Created comprehensive cheat sheet - students love shortcuts and they improve productivity

## Official Documentation Sources
- VS Code: code.visualstudio.com
- MDN: developer.mozilla.org (for all web platform topics)
- Git: git-scm.com
- Node.js/npm: nodejs.org, docs.npmjs.com
- GitHub: docs.github.com
- Astro: docs.astro.build
- Starlight: starlight.astro.build

## Video Duration Summary
- Development Environment: ~50-55 minutes (4 topics)
- Web Platform: ~120-135 minutes (8 topics)
- **Total: ~2.75-3.25 hours of video content**

## User Preferences
- Appreciates concise, focused content
- Wants practical, actionable information
- Prefers official documentation links over third-party resources
- Values clear structure and consistent patterns
- Open to suggestions but makes final decisions on scope/depth
- Students love keyboard shortcuts - include them throughout materials

## If Continuing This Work
- All topic files are complete in the Astro site
- Video guides (video-guides.md) are complete for all 12 topics
- Keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet is part of the site
- Guide overview (guide/index.md) is finalized
- Astro Starlight site is fully functional - all content lives in `site/src/content/docs/guide/`
- User may want to edit company-specific tool restrictions later
- Future work might include: styling customizations, adding exercises/quizzes, creating actual video content, deployment configuration
