:::tip
I am using the name "company" here until we make this authenticated in lieu of using the real company name.

## Project Status

This is a **review** version of this site. 

When it goes *live*, it will require authentication to access. I'm working with the security team to make it so that only company employees can access it.

<Todo who="Hypertheory" >
Integrate this into the existing company authentication system before launch.
</Todo>

<Todo who="Hypertheory">
Move this site to the *.hypertheory-labs.com domain when ready for production.
</Todo>


As discussed below, each section will have review questions and/or exercises added before the final version is complete. Their answers to the review questions will be submitted directly to Hypertheory for evaluation, however the students will be given opportunities to
correct their errors. 

For the practice exercises, they will submit a link to either their Github repository or a link to a Stackblitz project that contains their solution, and it will contain instructions on how to do that.

<Todo who="Hypertheory" >
I need to verify this will be acceptable with the company since they may have restrictions on using third-party services. There is a "plan b", if needed.
</Todo> 

## The Content 

The content is broken into three main sections:

1. The Development Environment
2. The Web Platform
3. Welcome to Angular (coming soon)


Each topic within a section will have a brief video at the top of the topic that introduces the topic and explains why it is important for Angular development. Some topics will have short "silent" demonstration videos of common tasks (e.g. setting up Git, using browser devtools, etc.
) that will work as a reference for the students during the training.


### Section 1: The Development Environment

The first section (*The Development Environment*) is designed to help developers that are coming from other development environments (like Visual Studio) get comfortable with the tools and workflows used in Angular development. For some developers, entering a class where they've 
never seen Visual Studio Code, Git, Node.js, and the command line can be intimidating. This section aims to level-set everyone so they can focus on learning Angular without struggling with the tools.

<Todo who="Company">
If there are custom instructions on how they should request access to company resources/tools, add those here, or include them in the welcome materials.
</Todo>

The emphasis here will be brief familiarity. They don't need to become experts in Git or Node.js, but they do need to understand the basic workflows and concepts so they can follow along with the Angular training without getting stuck on tooling issues.

It would be helpful if the student took the internal Git training before starting this course, if they are completely new to Git. We don't do "advanced" things with Git in class, but for some, it is a stumbling block and having that background will help.

I think the "Evaluation" of this section will be a few questions, but also them affirming that they have set up their development environment correctly.

<Todo who="Hypertheory">
Hypertheory will check with the company to see if there are any specific requirements for this section.
</Todo>

### Section 2: The Web Platform 

This is the "meat" of the pre-work. Understanding how the web works is crucial for Angular development. This section covers the foundational technologies of the web, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

Each topic will have review questions and/or practice exercises to help reinforce the concepts. The goal is for the student to have a solid understanding of how web applications work before diving into Angular.

I'm adding "additional resources" for those that want to go deeper, or for those that need more background. The goal is to give them just enough to be successful in the Angular training without overwhelming them.

### Section 3: Welcome to Angular (Coming Soon)

I'm going to add a brief introduction to Angular itself as the final section of the pre-work. This will give them a taste of what Angular is and how it fits into the web platform.

This section will divulge some of the reasons for emphasizing certain topics in the earlier sections. 

It will also have links to the "official" Angular documentation for further reading, along with links to the Angular tutorials, and other resources to help them get started.

I'm thinking this section will not have an assessment, as it is more of a "welcome" and orientation to Angular itself for those that really want to get a head start.







This site is being developed as a **proof of concept** for Angular 100 Pre-Work training materials.

### Current State

- ✅ Video recording guides complete (~2.75-3.25 hours total content)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet integrated



## Feedback & Suggestions

### From Stakeholders


<Todo who="Company">
Please share this link with anyone that would like to provide feedback on the content. They can either email me directly (jeff@hypertheory.com), or, if they are comfortable do so, there is a link at the top of this page where they can:

- Submit Github Issues (See below)
- Fork this repo and send me pull requests with suggested changes

</Todo>

### Technical Considerations

<Todo who="Hypertheory">
Follow up with company identity folks on creating a OIDC client for this site.
