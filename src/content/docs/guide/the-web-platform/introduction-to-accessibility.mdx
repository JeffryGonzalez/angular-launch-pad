Building accessible applications isn't just good practice - it's essential. Accessibility ensures that your applications can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. It's also increasingly a legal requirement in many jurisdictions. The good news is that much of accessibility comes down to writing good, semantic HTML and following established patterns.

## Why Accessibility is Important (Ethically)

Accessibility is about inclusion and equal access.

**Key Points:**
- **1 in 4 adults** in the US has some form of disability
- **Types of disabilities**:
  - Visual: Blindness, low vision, color blindness
  - Auditory: Deafness, hard of hearing
  - Motor: Limited mobility, tremors, paralysis
  - Cognitive: Learning disabilities, memory issues
  - Situational: Broken arm, bright sunlight on screen, noisy environment

**Ethical Arguments:**
- Everyone deserves equal access to information and services
- The web should be usable by all, regardless of ability
- Exclusion causes harm - people miss opportunities, services, information
- Many disabilities are temporary or situational

**The Social Model:**
- Disability isn't just medical
- Society creates barriers
- Inaccessible websites are one such barrier
- We can remove barriers through thoughtful design

**Why This Matters:**
As developers, we have the power to include or exclude people. Choosing to build accessible applications is choosing to build a more inclusive web.

## Why Accessibility is Important (Legally)

Accessibility is legally required in many contexts.

**Key Laws & Standards:**
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**: US law requiring accessible public accommodations, including websites
- **Section 508**: US federal agencies must have accessible technology
- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: International standard for web accessibility
  - Levels: A (minimum), AA (standard target), AAA (highest)
- **European Accessibility Act**: EU requirement for accessible digital services
- **AODA** (Canada), **Equality Act** (UK): Similar laws worldwide

**Legal Risks:**
- Lawsuits are increasing (thousands per year in US)
- Settlements can be costly
- Reputation damage
- Loss of customers

**Organizations Must Comply:**
- Government agencies
- Educational institutions
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare providers
- Retailers and service providers
- **Increasingly: All websites**

**Why This Matters:**
Companies hiring Angular developers expect accessible applications. Legal compliance is not optional. Understanding accessibility protects you and your employer.

## How Good Markup is Most of the Battle

Semantic HTML provides most accessibility features automatically.

**What Assistive Technology Needs:**
- Structure: Headings, landmarks, lists
- Meaning: What each element represents
- State: Is it checked? Required? Expanded?
- Relationships: Labels with inputs, groupings
- Navigation: Keyboard access, focus order

**Good Semantic HTML Provides This:**

**Bad (Inaccessible):**
```html
<div onclick="submitForm()">Submit</div>
<div class="checkbox"></div>
<span class="heading">Page Title</span>
```

**Good (Accessible):**
```html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
<input type="checkbox" id="agree" name="agree">
<h1>Page Title</h1>
```

**Why the Good Version Works:**
- `<button>` is keyboard accessible, has proper role, announces as button
- `<input type="checkbox">` announces state (checked/unchecked)
- `<h1>` creates document structure for navigation

**Key Practices:**
1. **Use semantic elements**: `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, etc.
2. **Add alt text to images**: `<img src="..." alt="Description">`
3. **Label form inputs**:
   ```html
   <label for="email">Email:</label>
   <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
   ```
4. **Use proper heading hierarchy**: `<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>` (don't skip levels)
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**: Text readable against background
6. **Make interactive elements keyboard accessible**: Can tab to them, activate with Enter/Space

**ARIA (When Semantic HTML Isn't Enough):**
```html
<!-- ARIA fills gaps for complex interactions -->
<div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title" aria-modal="true">
  <h2 id="dialog-title">Confirm Action</h2>
  ...
</div>
```

**The Rule:** Use semantic HTML first. Add ARIA only when necessary. "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA."

**Why This Matters:**
Angular components should output semantic HTML. Understanding accessibility helps you create inclusive components. Most accessibility issues come from poor HTML, which is easily fixable.

**Testing:**
- Keyboard only navigation (no mouse)
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Automated tools (axe DevTools, Lighthouse)
