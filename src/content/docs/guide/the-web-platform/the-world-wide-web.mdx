<VideoPlaceholder title="Introduction to the World Wide Web" />

The World Wide Web is the foundation upon which we build modern web applications. Understanding its history, architecture, and core protocols will help you make better decisions as a developer and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

## Origins (Tim Berners-Lee, etc.)

Understanding where the web came from provides context for how it works today.

**Key Points:**
- **1989**: Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web at CERN
- Original purpose: Share documents between scientists
- Key innovations:
  - HTML for document structure
  - HTTP for transferring documents
  - URLs for addressing documents
  - The first web browser and server
- **1991**: Web made publicly available
- **Mid-1990s**: Netscape, Internet Explorer, browser wars began
- **Today**: The web has evolved from documents to full applications

**Why This Matters:**
Many web concepts (URLs, links, documents) come from its origins as a document-sharing system. Understanding this explains why certain patterns exist and helps you grasp the web's architecture.

## How the WWW Relates to the Internet

The web and the internet are not the same thing.

**Key Points:**
- **Internet**: Global network of interconnected computers (the infrastructure)
- **World Wide Web (WWW)**: A service that runs on the internet
- Other internet services: email, file transfer (FTP), video streaming
- **Analogy**: Internet is like the road system; the web is like the cars that use it
- The web uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol on top of internet infrastructure

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding this distinction helps you grasp network issues. Problems can happen at different layers - internet connectivity vs. web server issues. This knowledge aids troubleshooting.

## What is a "Web Server"

A web server delivers web content to clients.

**Key Points:**
- **Software** that responds to HTTP requests and sends HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
- **Hardware** (computer) that runs web server software
- Popular web servers: Nginx, Apache, IIS, Node.js/Express
- **For Angular**: Development server (`ng serve`) during development; production server (Nginx, Apache) for deployed apps
- Listens on a port (usually 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)

**How It Works:**
1. Browser requests: `http://example.com/index.html`
2. Web server receives request
3. Server finds or generates the content
4. Server sends content back to browser
5. Browser displays content

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding web servers helps you deploy Angular applications and troubleshoot hosting issues. Angular apps are "static" files served by web servers, unlike server-rendered apps.

**Further Reading:**
- [What is a Web Server (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)

## What is a "Web Browser"

A web browser requests, receives, and renders web content.

**Key Points:**
- Software that displays web pages (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Main functions**:
  - Send HTTP requests to web servers
  - Receive HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
  - Parse and render the content
  - Execute JavaScript
  - Handle user interaction
- **Components**: UI, rendering engine, JavaScript engine, networking, storage
- Different browsers have different capabilities and quirks

**Why This Matters:**
Your Angular app runs in browsers. Understanding browser capabilities and differences helps you write compatible code, debug issues, and optimize performance. Browser developer tools are essential for development.

- [Browser Engines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Engine/Browser)

## Very Basics of HTTP as an Application Layer Protocol

HTTP is the protocol browsers use to communicate with servers.

**Key Points:**
- **HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol
- **Request/Response**: Client asks, server answers
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent (no memory between requests)
- **Request includes**: Method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, headers, optional body
- **Response includes**: Status code, headers, body (content)

**Common HTTP Methods:**
- **GET**: Retrieve data (read)
- **POST**: Send data to server (create)
- **PUT**: Update data
- **DELETE**: Remove data

**Example HTTP Request:**
```
GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
```

**Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"users": [...]}
```

**Why This Matters:**
Angular apps communicate with backend APIs using HTTP. Understanding requests/responses helps you debug network issues, work with APIs, and understand how your app gets data.

- [HTTP Messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)

## Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS

HTTPS is secure HTTP.

**Key Points:**
- **HTTP**: Plain text - anyone can read the data
- **HTTPS**: Encrypted - data is secure during transfer
- HTTPS = HTTP + TLS/SSL (encryption layer)
- **Padlock icon** in browser indicates HTTPS
- HTTPS requires SSL certificate on server
- **Modern standard**: All websites should use HTTPS

**What HTTPS Protects:**
- Login credentials
- Personal information
- Payment data
- Prevents tampering with content in transit

**Why This Matters:**
Modern web security requires HTTPS. Browsers warn users about HTTP sites. Many features (geolocation, service workers) only work with HTTPS. Production Angular apps must use HTTPS.

## Quick Overview of TCP and How It Relates to the WWW

TCP provides reliable data transfer for HTTP.

**Key Points:**
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol
- **Purpose**: Ensures data packets arrive reliably and in order
- HTTP runs "on top of" TCP
- **TCP provides**:
  - Connection establishment (handshake)
  - Reliable delivery (resends lost packets)
  - Ordered delivery (packets arrive in sequence)
- **Layer model**: Application (HTTP) → Transport (TCP) → Internet (IP)

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding that HTTP relies on TCP helps explain network behavior. Connection timeouts, slow networks, and packet loss all happen at the TCP level, affecting HTTP performance.

**Further Reading:**
- [TCP/IP Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_and_tcp)

## Web Standards - HTML, CSS, HTTP, etc.

Standards ensure consistency across browsers and servers.

**Key Points:**
- **Standards bodies**:
  - W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) - HTML, CSS
  - WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) - HTML Living Standard
  - IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) - HTTP, TCP
  - TC39 - JavaScript/ECMAScript
- **Open standards**: Anyone can implement them
- **Why standards matter**: Interoperability between browsers, servers, tools

**Key Web Standards:**
- HTML - Document structure
- CSS - Styling and layout
- JavaScript - Behavior and interactivity
- HTTP - Communication protocol
- DOM - Document manipulation API

**Why This Matters:**
Web standards allow your Angular app to work across different browsers and platforms. Understanding standards helps you write portable, future-proof code.

**Further Reading:**
- [Web Standards (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards)
- [W3C Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/)

## How Web Standards Are Supported by Browsers

Not all browsers support all features equally.

**Key Points:**
- Browsers implement standards at different speeds
- **Feature support varies**:
  - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) have good support
  - Older browsers lag behind
  - Mobile browsers may differ from desktop
- **Check compatibility**: Use resources like "Can I Use"
- **Polyfills**: JavaScript code that adds missing features
- **Transpilation**: Convert modern code to older syntax (TypeScript → JavaScript)

**For Angular Developers:**
- Angular CLI handles most compatibility issues
- Targets specific browser versions in `browserslist`
- Automatically includes polyfills when needed

**Why This Matters:**
Not every user has the latest browser. Understanding compatibility helps you make informed decisions about which features to use and how to support older browsers.

## Web Sockets, Server Sent Events Overview

Real-time communication alternatives to traditional HTTP.

**WebSockets:**
- **Bidirectional** real-time communication
- Persistent connection between client and server
- Both can send messages anytime
- **Use cases**: Chat applications, live feeds, multiplayer games
- Example: Server pushes stock prices; client sends messages

**Server-Sent Events (SSE):**
- **One-way** communication from server to client
- Server pushes updates to browser
- Simpler than WebSockets
- **Use cases**: Live news feeds, notifications, progress updates

**Why This Matters:**
Some Angular applications need real-time features. Understanding when to use WebSockets vs SSE vs polling helps you choose the right approach for real-time data.

**Further Reading:**

- [Server-Sent Events (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)

## DNS and IP Addresses

How domain names map to server addresses.

**Key Points:**
- **IP Address**: Numerical address of a computer (e.g., `172.67.177.42`)
- **Domain Name**: Human-readable address (e.g., `example.com`)
- **DNS** (Domain Name System): Translates domain names to IP addresses
- **DNS Lookup Process**:
  1. Type `example.com` in browser
  2. Browser asks DNS server for IP address
  3. DNS returns IP address
  4. Browser connects to that IP address

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding DNS helps troubleshoot connection issues. Sometimes DNS problems appear as "site not found" errors. DNS changes take time to propagate when deploying apps.

- [How DNS Works](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)

## RESTful APIs Basics

REST is a common pattern for web APIs that Angular apps consume.

**Key Points:**
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer
- **API**: Application Programming Interface (how software talks to software)
- **RESTful principles**:
  - Resources identified by URLs (`/api/users`, `/api/users/123`)
  - Use HTTP methods meaningfully (GET to read, POST to create, etc.)
  - Stateless requests
  - Responses typically in JSON format

**Example REST API:**
- `GET /api/users` - List all users
- `GET /api/users/123` - Get user 123
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/123` - Update user 123
- `DELETE /api/users/123` - Delete user 123

**Why This Matters:**
Most Angular apps get data from REST APIs. Understanding REST conventions helps you work with backend APIs and design your own API interactions properly.

**Further Reading:**
- [RESTful APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST)
- [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)

## JSON as a Data Format

JSON is the standard format for exchanging data on the web.

**Key Points:**
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation
- Text-based, human-readable data format
- **Data types**: Objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null
- Language-independent (despite JavaScript in the name)
- Replaced XML as the primary format for web APIs

**Example JSON:**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "roles": ["user", "admin"]
}
```

**In Angular:**
- API responses are usually JSON
- Angular's `HttpClient` automatically parses JSON
- Easy to work with in TypeScript

**Why This Matters:**
JSON is everywhere in modern web development. Understanding its structure helps you work with API responses, debug network issues, and structure your data properly.

## Request/Response Cycle

Understanding the full lifecycle of a web request.

**The Cycle:**
1. **User Action**: Click link, submit form, app makes API call
2. **Browser Creates Request**: GET /api/data with headers
3. **DNS Lookup**: Convert domain to IP address
4. **TCP Connection**: Establish connection to server
5. **Send Request**: Browser sends HTTP request
6. **Server Processing**: Server handles request, queries database, etc.
7. **Server Response**: Sends back status code, headers, data
8. **Browser Receives**: Parses response
9. **Render/Process**: Display content or update app with data

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding this cycle helps you debug "slow" applications - you can identify which step is causing delays. It also helps you understand async operations in Angular.

**Further Reading:**
- [HTTP Messages (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)

## Common HTTP Status Codes

Status codes tell you the result of an HTTP request.

**Success (2xx):**
- **200 OK**: Request succeeded
- **201 Created**: Resource created successfully
- **204 No Content**: Success, but no data to return

**Redirection (3xx):**
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Resource moved to new URL
- **304 Not Modified**: Cached version is still valid

**Client Errors (4xx):**
- **400 Bad Request**: Malformed request
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required
- **403 Forbidden**: No permission to access
- **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn't exist

**Server Errors (5xx):**
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server crashed or error occurred
- **502 Bad Gateway**: Server acting as proxy received invalid response
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server overloaded or down

**Why This Matters:**
Status codes help you handle errors properly in Angular. You'll write different logic for 404 (show "not found" message) vs 500 (show "server error" message) vs 401 (redirect to login).
