<VideoPlaceholder title="Introduction to Git and Version Control" />

You should take the in-house Git source control training prior to this training. We will use Git and Github during the class. We will use an abbreviated, classroom-focused workflow in class, so some very basic understanding is enough. How to create commits, how to push your code, how to clone code from a repository, etc. We won't use complex branching workflows and will do our best to avoid any conflicts during merge, but these are all skills that are necessary for being a good Angular developer. Consider this your "starter set".

## What is Version Control and Why Use It?

Version control tracks changes to your code over time.

**Key Points:**
- Version control saves snapshots (commits) of your code at different points in time
- You can revert to any previous version if something breaks
- Provides a complete history of who changed what and why
- Enables collaboration - multiple people can work on the same codebase
- Acts as backup - your code is stored remotely (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Required for professional development - every company uses it

**Why This Matters:**
Without version control, you're working without a safety net. Git lets you experiment fearlessly, knowing you can always undo changes. It's also essential for collaborating with others and contributing to open source projects.

## Git Basics: Clone, Add, Commit, Push, Pull

These five commands cover 90% of daily Git usage.

**Key Commands:**
- `git clone <url>` - Download a repository from GitHub to your computer
- `git add <file>` or `git add .` - Stage changes for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Save a snapshot with a descriptive message
- `git push` - Upload your commits to the remote repository (GitHub)
- `git pull` - Download latest changes from remote repository

**Typical Workflow:**
```bash
# Start of day
git pull

# Make changes to files...

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add user login feature"
git push
```

**Why This Matters:**
These five commands form your daily Git workflow in Angular development. You'll use them constantly to save your work, share it with teammates, and get updates from others.

## Understanding the Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository

Git has three main states for your files.

**Key Points:**
- **Working Directory**: Where you edit files - your actual project folder
- **Staging Area** (Index): Files you've marked to include in the next commit
- **Repository** (.git folder): The complete history of all commits

**The Flow:**
1. Edit files in working directory
2. `git add` moves changes to staging area
3. `git commit` saves staging area to repository
4. `git push` uploads repository to remote (GitHub)

**Check Status:**
- `git status` - See what's changed, what's staged, what's not

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding these three areas helps you understand what Git is doing. When a tutorial says "stage your changes," you'll know it means `git add`. When you see "commit your changes," you'll know that's `git commit`.

- [The Three States](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F#_the_three_states)

## Viewing History and Diffs

See what changed and when.

**Key Commands:**
- `git log` - View commit history
  - `git log --oneline` - Condensed view
  - `git log --graph --all` - Visual branch structure
- `git diff` - See unstaged changes
- `git diff --staged` - See staged changes
- `git show <commit-hash>` - See details of a specific commit

**Why This Matters:**
When debugging, you often need to see what changed. "It was working yesterday" becomes actionable when you can view yesterday's code. Git history is your project's story.

## .gitignore and Why Certain Files Shouldn't Be Tracked

Not everything should be committed to Git.

**Key Points:**
- `.gitignore` file specifies files/folders Git should ignore
- Common things to ignore:
  - `node_modules/` - Dependencies (huge, can be reinstalled)
  - Build output: `dist/`, `build/`
  - Environment files with secrets: `.env`
  - IDE files: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`
  - OS files: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`

**Angular-specific .gitignore:**
```
# dependencies
/node_modules

# build outputs
/dist
/tmp
/out-tsc

# IDEs
/.vscode
.idea/

# misc
/.angular/cache
.DS_Store
```

**Why This Matters:**
Ignoring `node_modules` keeps your repository small and fast - this folder can have thousands of files. Ignoring build outputs prevents conflicts. Ignoring secrets prevents accidentally exposing passwords or API keys publicly.

## What is GitHub/Remote Repositories

GitHub hosts your Git repositories in the cloud.

**Key Points:**
- **Git**: The version control tool on your computer
- **GitHub**: A website that hosts Git repositories online
- GitHub provides: backup, collaboration, code review, project management
- Alternatives exist: GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps
- **Remote**: The version of your repository on GitHub
- **Origin**: The default name for your primary remote

**Common Commands:**
- `git remote -v` - See your remote repositories
- `git clone` - Copy a remote repository to your computer
- `git push origin main` - Push to the main branch on origin remote

**Why This Matters:**
GitHub is where you'll collaborate with teams, contribute to open source, and showcase your work. Understanding the local (Git) vs remote (GitHub) distinction prevents confusion.

**Further Reading:**

- [GitHub Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)

## Basic Branching Concepts

Branches let you work on features without affecting the main codebase.

**Key Points:**
- **Branch**: An independent line of development
- **main** (or master): The primary branch, usually the production code
- Create branch: `git branch feature-name`
- Switch branch: `git checkout feature-name` or `git switch feature-name`
- Create and switch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
- See branches: `git branch`

**Simple Workflow:**
```bash
git checkout -b add-login-page
# work on login page...
git add .
git commit -m "Add login page"
git checkout main
git merge add-login-page
```

**Why This Matters:**
Branching lets you experiment without breaking working code. Even though we'll keep it simple in class, understanding branches is essential for professional development.

## Handling Basic Merge Conflicts

Sometimes Git can't automatically merge changes.

**Key Points:**
- **Conflict**: When two people edit the same lines and Git can't decide which to keep
- Git marks conflicts in your files:
  ```
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  Your changes
  =======
  Their changes
  >>>>>>> branch-name
  ```
- To resolve:
  1. Open the file
  2. Choose which version to keep (or combine them)
  3. Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
  4. `git add` the file
  5. `git commit`

**Avoiding Conflicts:**
- Pull often: `git pull` before starting work
- Communicate with team about who's working on what
- Keep commits small and frequent

**Why This Matters:**
Conflicts are a normal part of collaboration. Knowing how to resolve them prevents panic when they occur. The process is straightforward once you understand the format.
