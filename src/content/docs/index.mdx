## Time Commitment

For those with moderate web development experience, you should be able to work through these materials in **1-2 days**. If you're newer to web development, plan for more time—this is a self-paced journey, and there's no rush. The goal is understanding, not speed.

## Why This Matters

Training can best get you from "point a" to "point b" if everyone is starting at the same "point a". These materials are specifically selected to help you better understand how Angular works and how to successfully write Angular applications.
